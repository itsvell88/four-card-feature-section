## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

(1) Detail containers & components breakdown at the initial stage helps create smoother workflow and minimise debugging time
(2) Using percentage on margin & padding through media queries to avoid hard coding and achieve responsive layout with more seamless transition between screens
(3) Having descriptive class name improves readibility, speed up navigation, and makes CSS easier to maintain

### Continued development

(1) Optimise using semantic HTML to reduce unnecessary div usage
(2) Learn more about responsive layouts in CSS and key properties that make them work
(3) Simplify breakpoint strategy to make things easier to maintain, keeping the codes clean yet seamless across different screen sizes
